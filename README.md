# Merchant Madness
##### Developed by Kjip

## Introduction
As of writing this, a brand new project. As time goes on I will continue to update this file and post any relevant information.
Once I complete the project, I will post a reflection sheet, as I did in my [Happiness Tracker Project](https://github.com/KjipGamer/happiness-tracker).

## What I hope to accomplish with this project
I want to try a few different things with this project, such as:
- Maintaining a cleaner code structure
- Not nesting if-statements
- Scriptable objects

## Update log
